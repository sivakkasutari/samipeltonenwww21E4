                    <p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
                        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
                        specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
                        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
                        the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                        and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
                        including versions of Lorem Ipsum. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <figure>
                        <figcaption>A video</figcaption>
                        <video src="mov/a_view.mp4" controls width="300"></video>
                    </figure>
                    <br>

                    <p> Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots 
                        in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years 
                        old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
                        looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum 
                        passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, 
                        discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and
                        1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
                        written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular 
                        during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
                        comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                    <h2>Tables are making a comeback</h2>
                    <br>

                    <p> It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content 
                        of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a 
                        more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, 
                        content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages 
                        and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 
                        'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have 
                        evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and
                        the like):
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <table>
                        <thead>
                            <tr>
                                <th colspan="3" style="background-color: tomato;">The table header</th>
                            </tr>
                            
                        </thead>

                        <tbody>
                            <tr>
                                <td>Name</td><td>Age</td><td>Country</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>John</td><td>21</td><td>Finland</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>Markku</td><td>25</td><td>Finland</td>
                            </tr>
                        </tbody>

                        <tfoot>
                            <tr colspan ="3">
                                <th colspan="3" style="background-color: tomato;">The table footer</th>
                            </tr>
                        </tfoot>
                    </table>
                    <br>

                    <p> There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have 
                        suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look
                        even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be
                        sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum
                        generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the
                        first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, 
                        combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks
                        reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, 
                        injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
